# Gammabots

A Farcaster mini app for deploying automated trading bots in seconds — without managing infrastructure or watching charts all day.

## How It Works

Each bot follows a simple, transparent lifecycle:

1. **Choose a Token** — Pick the token you want to trade. All bots trade token/ETH pairs on Base.

2. **Choose a Strategy** — Strategies define how the bot trades: when it buys, when it sells, and how it reacts to price movements. All strategies are written in GammaScript, a purpose-built language for automated trading logic.

3. **Configure & Fund** — Set your ETH amount and parameters, then fund the bot from your wallet.

4. **Bot Trades Automatically** — Once funded, the bot runs continuously, executing trades when conditions are met.

## Strategies Are NFTs

Each strategy is minted as an NFT and is immutable once created. This guarantees that every bot using a strategy is running the exact same code. Strategies are fully transparent and inspectable — you can always see exactly what a strategy does before using it.

## Fees

Gammabots charges a 0.3% fee on sell trades:
- 75% goes to the Gammabots protocol
- 25% goes to the Strategy NFT owner

Strategy creators earn ETH when their strategies are used.
